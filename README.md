# Would You Rather Project

## Description

Employee Polls in a web app that lets an employee create polls for coworkers. The process goes like this: An employee is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.

Users can be able to answer polls, see which polls they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post polls, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard
